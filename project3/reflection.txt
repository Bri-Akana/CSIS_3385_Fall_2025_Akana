The most important changes to the form are user input validations. These were mainly done using the the type attribute. I used type email, password and number. For the username and password, I implemented a pattern as a way to prevent XSS, SQL injections and brute force attacks. I also made all the fields required, so a user could not skip a step. I made the age minimum 18 because I was not sure what the form would be used for, so that was just a general safety precaution. It was fairly simple to determine what validation rules to apply because the form is not so different from most sign up forms, so I thought about the most common rules/restrictions. Plus, the fields themselves give a clue as to what the type attribute should be. This also leads to the placeholder text I used. I kept it straightforward and simple. The message section I found it much more efficient to use JavaScript to abide by the 10 word limit. I took my own liberty to also let it mean that the message could be empty which is why I labeled it as a comment in the HTML legend. One of the things I would do differently if this were a live production would be to change the CSS to make it more user friendly and appealing. I would also like to add something similar to what a lot of social media uses for free range text areas and have a counter on the corner for the user, so they could know exactly how many characters or words there currently are in the box. I would also like to list the password requirements underneath the password. Something like a red X for when it's not met and a green check mark for when it is. The form could use a lot more user visuals than what I was able to do and implement autocomplete more thoroughly. I would also add more accessibility features to it as well for screen readers.
